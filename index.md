## Welcome!!

**Overview of Project**

This semester, in ECE3400 Intelligent Systems, our class are building maze solving robots. We work with our lab parteners each week taking steps to reach our end goal. There are 4 labs total and at the end of the semester the robot will be able to autonomously solve a maze while searching for treasures!
